## STUM Results

This repository contains trained baseline models (STGCN, AGCRN, GraphWaveNet, D2STGNN, STAEformer and STID) and enhanced STUM models for each trained baseline. Test results are provided for comparison. The implementation is based on the IEEE T-ITS 2025 paper “Cross Space and Time: A Spatio-Temporal Unitized Model for Traffic Flow Forecasting” (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.09251), with the following citation:

### Implementation notes
We use the publicly available STUM (https://github.com/RWLinno/STUM) codebase as our training framework. To ensure smooth execution, we applied minor engineering fixes (guarding optional wandb logging, correcting import paths, and fixing logging typos). No changes were made to model architectures, loss functions, or optimisation procedures. Each pretrained baseline model and enhanced model corresponds to a configuration file in baseline-configs/. and enhanced-configs/. Pretrained checkpoints are hosted externally due to size constraints.
